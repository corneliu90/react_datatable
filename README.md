Hi, I made a simple project to develop my skills, the project works as follows:
If you are logged in as Role: Administrator, you have access to create people in the database, but if you are logged in as Role: User, you will only have view access.
I created a simple database, you can find it in my repository: users_json_server
The first login will take 50 seconds because the server is on render.com
Administrator login:
burlac.corneliu@gmail.com
password: 1111
Simple user logins:
marina.ecuador@gmail.com
password: 4444
